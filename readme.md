1. Currently it is a simple app built with the help of Streamlit for the UI, and an LLM is integrated and prompted properly to give appropriate responses. The LLM integration was done using the very powerful and easy to use LangChain Framework.

2. I built if for personal use so that I can prioritise my tasks depending on the energy level and how much time I have

3. Going further I plan to add more features! Please let me know if you have ideas on how to make this app better.
